# gatsby-theme-i18n & more

> **Note:** This is still very much a WIP project, and you'll hear when things are ready for an Alpha!

A collection of Gatsby themes based around Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n). This is the first step towards a first-class i18n support in Gatsby.

The alpha version of `gatsby-theme-i18n` will support the internationalization of Gatsby projects powered by MDX and will be accompanied by three child themes, namely for `react-intl`, `react-i18next`, and `@lingui/react`.
The plan is to further develop these themes and explore how i18n could be supported for more sources than MDX, like any data source!

You can find more information in the [Gatsby Days Lightning talk](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-06-23-Reconfiguring-Gatsby-Days/#i18n-theme) to see what the process to this was and how it'll continue.
